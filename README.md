### To run and test the implementation
There are three steps:
1. Setting Up the SAT-Solver
2. Place this code into the same folder as the SAT-solver
3. Run demo.py and follow the instructions

To set up the SAT-Solver:
1. Go to the [PyMiniSolvers](https://github.com/liffiton/PyMiniSolvers) Github
2. Follow the instructions on that page to set it up 

The next step is to place demo.py, conversion.py and LM.py (from this repository) into the same folder as the SAT-Solver.

Finally just run demo.py and follow the instructions.
